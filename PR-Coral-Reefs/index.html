                <h2>Coastal Crisis in Puerto Rico</h2>
                <p>
                    What's happening in Puerto Rico?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The map above shows coral reef sites that were assessed following Hurricanes Irma and Maria that devastated
                    Puerto Rico in 2017.  The data was collected during transect surveys and roving diver surveys between February 28
                    and May 7, 2018.  The sites shown on the map are triaged sites - the level of damage has been classified as "Minor",
                    "Moderate", or "Severe" and they have been given a restoration potential rating of "Low", "Medium", or "High".  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Puerto Rico has been facing significant challenges in recent years, including high rates of unemployment, 
                    uncertain status in terms of statehood or independence, lack of federal funding for social services, and a 
                    weakened economy due to natural disasters.   Due to the financial and social tolls that have plagued the island, especially since
                    Hurricane Maria in 2017, the government declared a state of emergency in April 2023.  Due to significant damage from hurricanes in recent years,
                    Puerto Rico's coast has decreased significantly. 
                  
                </p>
               <p>
                    To address coastal erosion in Puerto Rico, it is essential for the Department of Natural Resources and other stakeholders to work 
                    collaboratively and develop long-term solutions that consider the needs of the community and the environment.  
                    This may involve policies such as promoting sustainable land use practices, 
                    restoring and preserving the coastline and coral reefs, and implementing measures that consider the ecological dynamics of the coast. 
                    Involving local communities in decision-making processes, 
                    providing education and awareness programs, and ensuring that regulations are informed by scientific research and assessments can also contribute to effective coastal erosion management strategies.
                    </p>
                <p>    
                    Short-term solutions, such as beach nourishment, can provide temporary protection against erosion, but may not be sustainable in the long run.  
                    Building bans, such as the one in place in Rincon, Puerto Rico, can be more effective long-term solutions to prevent further development along vulnerable coastal areas.  
                    Other measures, such as bolstering the health of existing coral reefs and introducing artificial coral reefs during non-hurricane seasons, can also protect the shoreline.  
                    Challenges such as lack of funding and support from the federal government, ongoing lawsuits against FEMA, and issues with corruption in infrastructure development make it 
                    difficult to rely solely on government-funded solutions. Therefore, local government policies and community engagement are crucial in implementing effective strategies for 
                    addressing coastal erosion in Puerto Rico.

                  Local Threats to Puerto Rico Coral Reefs.  From the metadata:
                  Reef polygons are classified by estimated threat from coastal development. 
                  The threat to coral reefs from coastal development was based on size of 
                  cities, ports, and airports; size and density of hotels; and coastal population pressure 
                  (a combination of population density, growth, and tourism growth). 
                  Values of 0 indicate low threat, 100 indicate medium threat, 1000 indicate high threat.
